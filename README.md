AoC 2024 attempt

**Problem set one notes:**
# part one
Had to read a file, split the two number columns into lists, sort the lists, 
subtract corresponding index numbers. First attempt was a fail, because I didn't consider 
that I should always check which element is bigger. Overall a fun task.

# part two 
Finding occurence of element [i] from left list in right list
Started implementing it with map, found a better method for this in Collections class
Might re-visit and try with a map at some point
