AoC 2024 attempt

**Problem set one notes:**
Day 1
# part one
Had to read a file, split the two number columns into lists, sort the lists, 
subtract corresponding index numbers. First attempt was a fail, because I didn't consider 
that I should always check which element is bigger. Overall a fun task.

# part two 
Finding occurence of element [i] from left list in right list
Started implementing it with map, found a better method for this in Collections class
Might re-visit and try with a map at some point

Day 2

# part one
I fully made the code harder than it needed to be, also decided to exclude half of the checks cause of bad 
understanding of the instructions. Note for future attempts: 
- Make a full plan of what you want code to do, don't wing it;
- Keep it simple, if you nest too much stuff together you probably doing something wrong;
