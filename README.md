AoC 2024 attempt

**Problem set one notes:**
# H1 - part one
Had to read a file, split the two number columns into lists, sort the lists, 
subtract corresponding index numbers. First attempt was a fail, because I didn't consider 
that I should always check which element is bigger. Overall a fun task.
